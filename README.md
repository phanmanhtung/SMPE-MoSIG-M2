## To-Do List

- [x] **Read Popper’s text** and write a short summary in your GitHub repository.
      
Karl Popper's "Conjectures and Refutations" revolves around the idea of distinguishing science from pseudo-science. Popper explains that science progresses through bold theories that are testable and open to refutation, as seen in Einstein’s theory of relativity. On the other hand, theories like Marxism and psychoanalysis, though influential, are criticized for being irrefutable—they can explain anything and are not genuinely tested by risky predictions. Popper emphasizes that a good scientific theory should make bold predictions that risk being proven wrong. This openness to falsification is what separates true science from pseudo-scientific methods.

- [ ] **Criticize every figure of Jean-Marc’s slides** by:
  - Applying the checklist for good graphics.
  - Proposing a better representation (hand-drawing is fine) that passes the checklist.
- [ ] **Report this work** for at least 3 figures in your GitHub/GitLab project.
- [ ] **MOOC:** Complete exercise 5 of module 2 (Challenger). Write a short text explaining what is good and wrong about this document (you may want to provide an updated version of the notebook) and upload it to your GitHub/GitLab space.
