|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Readability**             | Cryptic info, overloaded visuals                   | Simplify, reduce graphical objects                              |
| **Use of Color**            | Similar colors, green (bad for video)              | Use distinct, high-contrast colors; avoid green on video         |
| **Labeling & Annotations**  | Unclear axis labels, missing units                 | Add clear, self-contained labels with units                     |
| **Bar Charts**              | Random order of bars                               | Order bars logically (alphabetical, temporal, etc.)             |
| **Line Graphs**             | Too many lines (>6), hard to differentiate         | Use fewer lines, distinguish with color/patterns                |
| **Pie Charts**              | Too many slices, confusing layout                  | Limit categories or switch to bar charts                        |
| **Histograms**              | Inadequate step sizes, missing probabilities       | Adjust steps, visualize probabilities from 0 to 1               |
| **Graph Titles**            | Vague or missing titles                            | Add clear, self-contained titles                                |
