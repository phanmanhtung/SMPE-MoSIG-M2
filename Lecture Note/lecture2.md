# What is Science?
- **Science** is a way to explore and understand the world using facts and experiments.
- It’s about figuring out how things work and trying to answer big questions.

## Key Ideas

### 1. How Science Works
   - **Observe** stuff around you  
   - **Guess (Hypothesize)** why things might be happening  
   - **Test it!** Try experiments to see if your guess holds up  
   - Repeat and check until things make sense  

   *Claude Bernard* → says we do science in a loop: see, guess, test, repeat!

### 2. Popper’s Big Idea
   - **Karl Popper**: Science = being able to prove something wrong (aka *falsifiability*).
   - If we can’t test it or prove it wrong, it’s not really science.
   - Good theories are like *rules* that say “this shouldn’t happen” — and if it does, we might need a new theory.

### 3. Kuhn’s Cycle of Science
   - **Thomas Kuhn** says science doesn’t just build in a straight line — it has stages:
     - **Pre-science** = no agreement on anything
     - **Normal science** = everyone works under one main idea (paradigm)
     - **Crisis** = weird findings shake things up
     - **Revolution** = major change to new ideas
   - After a revolution, a new “normal” is set, and the cycle can start again.

### 4. Lakatos’ Layers
   - **Imre Lakatos**: Think of science as having a “hard core” (basic ideas) with a “protective belt” of theories.
   - We test the “belt” theories first, but the “core” ideas are more protected and change less often.

### 5. Computer Science and Science
   - **Computer Science** is part science, part tech. It deals with:
     - **Algorithms** (steps to solve problems)
     - **Programming Languages** (telling computers what to do)
     - **Hardware** (the machines themselves)
   - It’s a mix of theory (ideas) and practice (tech) — like building and experimenting at the same time!

### 6. Science is Teamwork
   - Scientists don’t work alone. They’re in teams, universities, and worldwide networks (IEEE, ACM, etc.).
   - Conferences, papers, and projects are where ideas are shared.

### 7. Checklist: Is it Science?
   - Focuses on the natural world  
   - Uses testable ideas  
   - Relies on evidence  
   - Involves the science community  
   - Keeps leading to more research

## Bottom Line on Science
- **Science = collaboration and change**  
- It’s a shared effort to learn more, question ideas, and evolve our understanding.
