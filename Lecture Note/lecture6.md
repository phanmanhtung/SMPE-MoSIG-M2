# Lecture Notes: Scientific Publications and Integrity (Nov 14, 2024)

## **1. What are Scientific Publications?**
- **History**:
  - Journals have been around since 1665 (*Journal des sçavans* in Paris, *Philosophical Transactions* in London).
- **Why Publish?**:
  - Written by experts for other experts.
  - Helps share new ideas and builds on old discoveries.
  - A way to record and grow knowledge over time.
- **How it Works**:
  - Scientists write papers → peers review them → journals publish them.
  - Two main types:
    - **Traditional**: Readers/libraries pay to access.
    - **Open Access**: Authors pay, and papers are free for everyone.

## **2. Where Can You Publish?**
- **Options**:
  - Journals, conferences, workshops, or preprint platforms like arXiv.
- **How to Pick**:
  - Discuss with your team.
  - Think about speed, visibility, and the reputation of the journal or event.
- **Watch Out for Plagiarism**:
  - Copying someone’s work can ruin your career permanently.

## **3. Measuring Success in Research**
- **Scientometrics (Fancy Word for Metrics)**:
  - *Impact Factor*: How often a journal’s articles are cited.
  - *h-index*: Measures how many times a scientist’s work is cited.
- **Weird Extras**:
  - Numbers like *Erdős number* or *Dijkstra number* show how closely someone worked with famous scientists.
- **Ranking Systems**:
  - Universities and researchers are judged by their papers and citations.
  - Example: SIGAPS in France gives hospitals money based on the ranking of published papers.
  
## **4. Problems with the System**
- **Cheating the System**:
  - Researchers, publishers, and even universities try to game the numbers.
- **What’s Wrong?**:
  - Too much focus on *how much* you publish, not on quality.
  - Paywalls make it hard to access research.
  - Open Access can be expensive for scientists, especially in poorer countries.
- **Impact**:
  - Discourages collaboration and makes it harder for everyone to benefit from science.

## **Personal Thoughts: Why It’s Unfair**
The current system feels like a big trap. Researchers are forced to keep publishing to stay relevant, which can lead to rushed or low-quality work. Metrics like the h-index and impact factor seem helpful, but they actually encourage quantity over quality. It’s all about looking good, not doing good science.

On top of that, publishers make huge profits while the people actually doing the work (scientists and reviewers) don’t get paid. Open Access was supposed to help, but now researchers have to pay high fees to make their work free for others. This leaves out scientists from less wealthy countries, making the system even more unfair.

Science is supposed to help everyone, but the current system focuses more on money and fame. We need a new system that makes research open, fair, and accessible to all.
