# Data Management Plan (DMP) Basics

## 1. **What is Research Data?**
   - **Data Types**: Facts, observations, recordings, measurements, computer results, etc.
   - **Formats**: Can be numerical, descriptive, visual, or tactile.
   - **Not Included**: Early drafts, future work plans, peer reviews, personal notes.

## 2. **Personal and Sensitive Data**
   - **Personal Data**: Info that can identify a person directly (name, address) or indirectly (details that can be cross-referenced).
   - **Sensitive Data**: Race, politics, health, biometrics, etc. Extra care is needed!

## 3. **What is a Data Management Plan (DMP)?**
   - A **DMP** is a doc that:
      - Describes data you’ll collect.
      - Explains how you'll manage, analyze, and store data.
      - Outlines how data will be shared and preserved after the project.

## 4. **Why Use a DMP?**
   - **Aims for FAIR** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data.
   - Helps keep research time-efficient and reproducible.
   - Follows the motto: *"As open as possible, as closed as necessary."*

## 5. **Core Parts of a DMP**
   - **Data Description**: Explain what data you’ll use or create.
   - **Documentation**: Helps others understand and reuse data.
   - **Storage & Backup**: Data safety during research.
   - **Legal & Ethical Requirements**: Follow data laws, e.g., GDPR.
   - **Sharing & Preservation**: How to share and save data long-term.

## 6. **Roles in Data Management**
   - **Data Managers**: Responsible for handling the data (could be a project engineer).
   - **Resources Needed**: Time, budget, tools for FAIR data.

---

## 7. **Choosing a Data Repository**
   - Look for trusted repositories that support identifiers, metadata, and access controls.
   - Options: **Zenodo** (multidisciplinary, free), **Dryad** (science, paid), etc.
   - For code: **GitHub** & **Software Heritage** for long-term storage.

## 8. **Data Quality and Security**
   - **Quality Control**: Use calibration, data checks, peer review.
   - **Security**: Protect sensitive info; back up in secure locations.
   - **Anonymization**: For personal data, consider pseudonymization or encryption.

---

## 9. **Licensing and Ethics**
   - **Data Access Licenses**: Decide on open or restricted access.
   - **Ethics**: Be aware of potential ethical issues in collecting, storing, and sharing data.

---

## 10. **Evaluating a DMP**
   - Checklists and tools help evaluate if a DMP meets standards.
   - Funders may require specific evaluation criteria, especially for sensitive data.

**Summary**: DMPs help make data organized, shareable, and safe, ensuring research stays valuable and usable over time
