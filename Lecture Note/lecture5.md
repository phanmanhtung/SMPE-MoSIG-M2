## Lecture 1: Why Visualization Matters

### Key Points
- **Presentation of Data**:
  - Essential for clear communication of scientific results.
  - Visuals help spot patterns, relationships, and outliers that might not be obvious in raw data.
- **Example Data Sets**:
  - Multiple datasets with similar statistical properties can look very different when plotted.
  - A simple linear model might seem appropriate, but visualizing data can reveal hidden non-linearities or outliers.
- **Important Takeaways**:
  - Always plot your data to avoid misleading analyses.
  - A visualization tells a story that raw statistics cannot, revealing potential flaws in data interpretation or analysis.

## Lecture 2: Correlation vs. Causation

### Key Points
- **Correlation Basics**:
  - Correlation measures the relationship between two variables, ranging from -1 (perfect negative) to +1 (perfect positive).
  - Correlation does not imply causation – just because two things occur together doesn’t mean one causes the other.
- **Examples & Misconceptions**:
  - Funny but misleading correlations, like pirate numbers and global temperatures, highlight the need for critical thinking.
  - Spurious correlations can appear significant in big data due to sheer volume.
- **Experimental vs. Observational Data**:
  - Experimental data is more controlled and better for deducing causation (with replication and randomization as key strategies).
  - Observational data is useful for forming hypotheses but has limitations for proving causation.
- **Simpson’s Paradox**:
  - A phenomenon where trends in different groups reverse when the groups are combined. This shows that context is vital when interpreting data.
- **Practical Tips**:
  - Be aware of biases and design your experiments properly (replication and randomization matter).
  - Don't over-rely on statistical analyses to make up for poor experimental design.
